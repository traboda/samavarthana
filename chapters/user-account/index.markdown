# User Account Management

## Features
Implement a user account management in the backend ([Django]) with the following features:
- **Registration**: Users should be able to register using their email, password, and name.
- **Login**: Users should be able to log in using their email and password.
- **Authentication**: Use the [Chowkidar] library for user login, authentication, and logout.

## Implementation Plan
TODO: Add instructions how to breakdown these problems into smaller problems and specify the data requirements if any.
